# -Alcohol-Detection-with-Vehicle-Control
This project aims to enhance vehicle safety by integrating an alcohol detection module with braking control and police alert features. When alcohol is detected from the driver's breath, the system immediately disables the vehicle’s movement and sends the driver’s identity to a connected police database.
